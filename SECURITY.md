## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report Privately
Send details to our security team via:
- **Email**: security@example.com (replace with actual contact)
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab

### 3. Include These Details
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

### 4. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies by severity (see below)

## Severity Levels

### Critical (Fix within 24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data exposure of sensitive information

### High (Fix within 1 week)
- Authentication bypass
- Significant data leakage
- Denial of service attacks

### Medium (Fix within 2 weeks)
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site scripting (if applicable)
- Input validation issues

### Low (Fix within 1 month)
- Minor information leakage
- Configuration issues
- Non-exploitable bugs

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Secure Credentials**: Never hardcode vCenter credentials
3. **Network Security**: Use secure connections to vCenter
4. **Access Control**: Limit script execution to authorized users
5. **Audit Logs**: Monitor script execution and results

### For Contributors
1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
2. **Credential Handling**: Never log or expose credentials
3. **Error Messages**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in errors
4. **Dependencies**: Keep PowerCLI and other modules updated
5. **Code Review**: All security-related changes require review

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures
- **Read-Only Operations**: Script only reads VM configurations
- **No Credential Storage**: Credentials are handled by PowerCLI
- **Input Validation**: Parameters are validated before use
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in errors
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative security settings by default

### Planned Security Enhancements
- Enhanced input validation
- Audit logging capabilities
- Role-based access control integration
- Encrypted configuration storage

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

### Our Commitment
1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the issue
3. **Communication**: We will keep you informed of our progress
4. **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisory (if desired)
5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate public disclosure timing

### Coordinated Disclosure
- We prefer coordinated disclosure after a fix is available
- We will work with you on disclosure timing
- Public disclosure typically occurs 90 days after initial report
- Critical issues may be disclosed sooner with fixes

## Security Contacts

- **Primary Contact**: security@example.com
- **Backup Contact**: maintainer@example.com
- **PGP Key**: Available upon request

## Hall of Fame

We recognize security researchers who help improve our security:

*No vulnerabilities reported yet - be the first!*
